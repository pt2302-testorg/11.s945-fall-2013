{{< anchor "In-class_Idea_Notes" >}}{{< /anchor >}}In-class Idea Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

These notes are completed and submitted at the end of each class session. Ten minutes at the end of each class is allocated for everyone to write or draw a half-page idea note reflecting on the dialogue that has taken place. Students may literally write or draw anything in response, and everyone receives a full score (one point per class session) as long as the note is submitted. A few ideas of what to write include:

*   What does the talk inspire you to think about? Either as a practitioner, as a research, or as a citizen.
*   How does this particular talk connect to other topics in the term, if any?
*   Do you have any personal experience related to the discussion?
*   Did the dialogue change any of your prior notions about China? How so?
*   What if you were the presenter? Is there anything that you would do different?
*   On data, method and research design: Is there anything you have learned as research methods, to whatever depths that one class can offer?
*   Are there any ideas relevant to your term project topics?

{{< anchor "Literature_Synthesis" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Literature Synthesis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each pair of students will be assigned to one of the literature synthesis {{% resource_link 28aa22b4-dc4e-f8f6-2b97-78ceccd6ca8f "candidate topics" %}} to write and present a literature synthesis for China's urbanization. (The topic of the literature review may be the same as that of the {{% resource_link 2f74bf52-0c54-5aca-42b4-8845671bd27c "team project" %}}.) The deliverables include:

*   Presentation: 15 minutes including questions and answers
*   Written report: 3000 words
*   Students will write their reports individually but present them in pairs in a form of a debate; one student will focus on the positive perspective and the other will focus on the negative perspective.

### How to Write a Literature Synthesis

1.  Purpose
    
    The purpose of a literature synthesis is to add value. It is not simply a catalog of papers you have read.
    
2.  Stages / components
    1.  Problem formulation: overview of the subject, issue or theory; clarify the objectives of the literature review
    2.  Literature search: [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/), [Web of Science](http://wokinfo.com/), MIT Vera, [Google](https://www.google.com/), [TRB Online](https://trbonline.trb.tas.gov.au/)
    3.  Data categorization and evaluation  
        Four typical structures of organization:
        
        *   Chronological (by trend)
        *   Thematic
        *   Methodological
        *   Opinion: support, opposition, neutral, alternative perspective
        
        Critical appraisal of papers:
        *   Contribution: method, data, theory
        *   Impact on practice
        *   Limitations
    4.  Data analysis, interpretation and synthesis
        *   Similarity of papers: Identify trends and patterns
        *   Differences between papers: Resolve conflicts
        *   Relationships between papers
        *   New perspectives / new interpretations
        *   Gaps in the existing literature
        *   Point the way forward for further research
    5.  Conclusions
3.  Bibliography  
    Please provide full reference information and follow the [APA Style{{< sup "®" >}}](http://www.apastyle.org/). You can find a [basic introduction to the APA citation style](http://library.concordia.ca/help/howto/apa.php) from Concordia University Libraries.
4.  How to start

*   Read other papers' literature review sections and follow good styles.
*   Identify a few core papers (e.g., 7–15) and supplemental sources (e.g., 20–50).
*   Read the core papers carefully and summarize each separately as the starting point.
*   Follow Section 2 ("Stages/components" as detailed above).
